                            Hi, you can call me Basel. I'm a rising senior at Gharbiya STEM School. From tinder age, I
                            loved immersing myself in the hot Astrophysics topics. In my sophomore year, I tried to
                            elaborate my love for Physics more and more; therefore, I began to serve my local community
                            with Physics sessions. However, I didn't realy feel that I fullfiled my goal, so I decided
                            to create this website to facilitate the complex Physics topics- with my colleagues. I'm,
                            also, an ISSYP attendee so feel free to reach out if you have any questions :)

                            Hello there! I'm Adham Mohamed A student who follows his passion for game development and
                            seeks to make his own company. Once, while I was browsing in the game developing engine I
                            noticed a tab called "Game Physics". I discovered that you have the ability to add physics
                            to your game, make your own gravity, simulate a black hole, and much more. You can even make
                            your own physics concept and give it any weird name you like. All of this awakened my
                            curiosity to learn more about physics and discover how the world works to be able to make my
                            own "world" works.

                            I'm Aia Harby; I'm really enthusiastic about how physics is really applied to almost all the
                            aspects of our life â€” starting from the formation of the whole cosmos passing through the
                            rules by which the vehicles are driven, and reaching the smallest things like how to measure
                            the length of an object. What actually fascinated me about Physics are those ambiguous and
                            mysterious physics problems. Therefore, I found that my participation in such an initiative
                            as GSPJ would satisfy my interest in this field of science by translating the priceless
                            physics data into written papers that may benefit someone else.

                            Hi Everyone!
                            I am Omar Taha a student from Gharbia STEM school.

                            When I have joined Gharbia STEM, I understanded that physics is the science of giving
                            explanations to everything in the universe and a great enthusiasm grew in me for physics. I
                            fell in love with the electromagnetism and the electricy in our body.
                            Also, I loved combining the laws of physics during my work in school projects.

                            In response, I want to take GSPJ as an opportunity for myself to intensify my curiosity and
                            the curiosity of others.
                            I want to simplify the difficult concepts of physics through my literature review articles
                            to take my peers towards the love of the greatest science ever.

                            I am Eman Abodaher. I am obsessed with how physics concepts are used in our life. My second
                            biggest fear is to get lost in genuinely complicated physics equations and concepts. So, I
                            would be very glad by taking part in such a great work like the GSPJ to simplify more
                            concepts of physics and aggregate tons of research papers in one place. Indeed, my logical
                            mindset would force me to the side of applied physics.

                            I'm Ahmed Gouda I'm fascinated by how the physics try to describe every of the
                            universe from the sub-atomic level to the creation and behavior of celestial objects. I
                            believe that the best way to advancement is by understanding our surroundings to know how to
                            get benefit from all the resources around us, and that's what we will try to do: simplifying
                            physics.

                        Hi, you can call me Basel. I'm a rising senior at Gharbiya STEM School. From tinder age, I
                        loved immersing myself in the hot Astrophysics topics. In my sophomore year, I tried to
                        elaborate my love for Physics more and more; therefore, I began to serve my local community
                        with Physics sessions. However, I didn't realy feel that I fullfiled my goal, so I decided
                        to create this website to facilitate the complex Physics topics- with my colleagues. I'm,
                        also, an ISSYP attendee so feel free to reach out if you have any questions :)

                        seeks to make his own company. Once, while I was browsing in the game developing engine I
                        noticed a tab called "Game Physics". I discovered that you have the ability to add physics
                        to your game, make your own gravity, simulate a black hole, and much more. You can even make
                        your own physics concept and give it any weird name you like. All of this awakened my
                        curiosity to learn more about physics and discover how the world works to be able to make my
                        own "world" works.

                        would be very glad by taking part in such a great work like the GSPJ to simplify more
                        concepts of physics and aggregate tons of research papers in one place. Indeed, my logical
                        mindset would force me to the side of applied physics.

                        I'm Aia Harby; I'm really enthusiastic about how physics is really applied to almost all the

                        rules by which the vehicles are driven, and reaching the smallest things like how to measure
                        the length of an object. What actually fascinated me about Physics are those ambiguous and
                        mysterious physics problems. Therefore, I found that my participation in such an initiative
                        as GSPJ would satisfy my interest in this field of science by translating the priceless
                        physics data into written papers that may benefit someone else.

                        Hi Everyone!
                        I am Omar Taha a student from Gharbia STEM school.

                        When I have joined Gharbia STEM, I understanded that physics is the science of giving
                        explanations to everything in the universe and a great enthusiasm grew in me for physics. I fell
                        in love with the electromagnetism and the electricy in our body.
                        Also, I loved combining the laws of physics during my work in school projects.

                        In response, I want to take GSPJ as an opportunity for myself to intensify my curiosity and the
                        curiosity of others.
                        I want to simplify the difficult concepts of physics through my literature review articles to
                        take my peers towards the love of the greatest science ever.
