                            Hi, you can call me Seif. I'm a rising senior at Gharbiya STEM School. From tinder age, I
                            loved immersing myself in the hot Astrophysics topics. In my sophomore year, I tried to
                            elaborate my love for Physics more and more; therefore, I began to serve my local community
                            with Physics sessions. However, I didn't realy feel that I fullfiled my goal, so I decided
                            to create this website to facilitate the complex Physics topics- with my colleagues. I'm,
                            also, an ISSYP attendee so feel free to reach out if you have any questions :)

                            I'm Aia Harby; I'm really enthusiastic about how physics is really applied to almost all the
                            aspects of our life â€” starting from the formation of the whole cosmos passing through the
                            rules by which the vehicles are driven, and reaching the smallest things like how to measure
                            the length of an object. What actually fascinated me about Physics are those ambiguous and
                            mysterious physics problems. Therefore, I found that my participation in such an initiative
                            as GSPJ would satisfy my interest in this field of science by translating the priceless
                            physics data into written papers that may benefit someone else.

                        I'm Abdelrahman Helal. I'm fascinated by how the physics try to describe every of the
                        universe from the sub-atomic level to the creation and behavior of celestial objects. I
                        believe that the best way to advancement is by understanding our surroundings to know how to
                        get benefit from all the resources around us, and that's what we will try to do: simplifying
                        physics.

                    STEM high school students from Egypt. It will provide pi-weekly review articles discussing specific
                    topics from different physics fields. The website will give the physics enthusiastics the
                    opportunity to explore different advanced concepts in a simple, and concluding way that will
                    intellectually entertain them.
